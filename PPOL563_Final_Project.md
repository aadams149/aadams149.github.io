#### Final Project


In times of public health crisis, it is essential that officials and science communicators are able to reach as many people as possible to inform them of mitigation and prevention measures, research updates, available resources, and new laws regarding individual or organizational activity. The emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus which causes COVID-19) presents an interesting and novel phenomenon; it is the first global pandemic during the social media age. Prior epidemics this century, like SARS in 2002, H1N1 flu in 2009, and Ebola in 2014, either happened when social media platforms were young and not widely used, or were geographically isolated or limited in spread by pathogen-specific factors. Public health communication in the United States faces an additional hurdle. The leader of one of the two major national political parties (and the immediate former president) actively and vocally opposed many of the suggestions offered by top-level health advisors, leading many in the country to become distrustful of government messaging around the virus.
